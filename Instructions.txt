
CV Builder




We used eclipse, so we prefer running the code on eclipse.
Create a package named project and add the code in the package with correct class names.

To add the image save the image in drive D by the name "CV", and set image = new ImageIcon("D:\\CV.jpeg");

Hopefully no error comes up.
